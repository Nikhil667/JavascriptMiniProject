5. Project Name:- Javascript Mini Projects 
    a. The project's main page is built using HTML and Tailwind CSS.
    b. It contains three links to the different JS Web Apps:-
        1) Weather App 
        2) To-Do List
        3) Game - Guess A Number
5(a) Rather than creating a mini JS project, I've created three mini apps and accommodated them in a single webpage. This function makes it easier 
        for the user to access these apps again and again.
5(b) The home page is created using HTML and Tailwind CSS.
       1) All three apps are created by using HTML, CSS and JS.
       2) Weather App uses the API to show today's weather of your location.
5(c) 1) Weather App - This app uses API(OpenWeather API) to get information from its server using the user's current location. It then fetches the 
            required information about the weather and displays it on the user's screen. Information includes the user's current location, 
            temperature and description of the weather. 
       2) To-Do List App - In this program, the user can store their daily tasks and remove them also. It can be used to increase productivity.
       3) Guess A Number - In this game, a random number is chosen using the random() then the user has to guess a number in a 
           maximum of ten guesses. If the user guesses the number in under ten guesses it wins or loses. Features include resetGame() - which resets 
           the game, setGameOver() - which starts a new game, checkGuess() - which compares the user's guess with a random number and it also 
           stores previous guesses of the user.
